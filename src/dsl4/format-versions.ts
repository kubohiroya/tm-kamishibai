 * The index DSL 4.0 did not have: every serialized format this build publishes, and its version.

 * `asset-reload-policy`, `asset-distribution-profile`, `runtime-artifact-descriptor` and the rest.
 * The values agree, but nothing said *which formats exist*, so a new one could be added without
 * anybody noticing that it now had to be versioned too. This module is that list.
 *
 * Each entry names the module that owns the format. The owner keeps its own constant and its own
 * validator; this index does not replace them, and `test/dsl4-format-contracts.test.ts` pins the
 * entries that have an exported constant to that constant so the two cannot drift apart.
