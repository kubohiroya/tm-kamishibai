 * The navigation session as its hosts drive it.

 * `createDsl4NavigationSession` returns more than this; the type lists what the TurboWarp runtime
 * host, the preview session, and the startup helper actually call, so those call sites stop going
 * through an index signature that makes every member possibly undefined.
 *
 * The signatures restate the session's own rather than deriving them, because the hosts must be
 * able to build a session-shaped double without importing `navigation-session.js` -- the preview
 * session does exactly that. Results stay `unknown` where the caller only forwards or awaits them;
 * widening those to the concrete record types would tie every host to the controller's snapshot
 * shape for no gain.
